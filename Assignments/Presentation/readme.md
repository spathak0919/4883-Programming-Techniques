### P108 -- Maximum Sum

### Problem Description:

A problem that is simple to solve in one dimension is often much more difficult to solve in more than
one dimension. Consider satisfying a boolean expression in conjunctive normal form in which each
conjunct consists of exactly 3 disjuncts. This problem (3-SAT) is NP-complete. The problem 2-SAT
is solved quite efficiently, however. In contrast, some problems belong to the same complexity class
regardless of the dimensionality of the problem.
