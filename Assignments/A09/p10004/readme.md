## P10004 - BiColoring
### Description:

The input consists of several test cases. Each test case starts with a line containing the number n
(1 < n < 200) of different nodes. The second line contains the number of edges l. After this, l lines will
follow, each containing two numbers that specify an edge between the two nodes that they represent.
A node in the graph will be labeled using a number a (0 â‰¤ a < n).
An input with n = 0 will mark the end of the input and is not to be processed.
