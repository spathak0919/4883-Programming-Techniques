## P11396 - Claw Decomposition
### Description:

There will be several cases in the input file. Each case starts with the number of vertices in the graph,
V (4 ≤ V ≤ 300). This is followed by a list of edges. Every line in the list has two integers, a and b,
the endpoints of an edge (1 ≤ a, b ≤ V ). The edge list ends with a line with a pair of ‘0’. The end of
input is denoted by a case with V = 0. This case should not be processed.
